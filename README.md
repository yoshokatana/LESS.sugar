This is (or will be) a proper, working LESS sugar for Espresso 2. It was forked from hawx, and some code was inspired by the other deprecated LESS sugar by Elliott Cable. Here's the status of the initial commit, in hawx's own words:

"I've got a sort of working LESS sugar. It doesn't like nested selectors at the moment, but mixins and variables are ok. Feel free to fork it and improve because I probably won't be spending much more time on it."

#STATUS#
I'm going to test variables and mixins, then get to work getting nesting to work properly.
