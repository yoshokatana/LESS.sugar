# WARNING: This project is incomplete #

I've switched over to using Sublime Text for most of my development work, so I don't think I'll get around to finishing this. I highly recommend you check out [Alexander Weiss's fork](https://github.com/alexanderweiss/LESS.sugar) which is being actively maintained and updated, and works really well.

> This is (or will be) a proper, working LESS sugar for Espresso 2. It was forked from hawx, and some code was inspired by the other deprecated LESS sugar by Elliott Cable. Here's the status of the initial commit, in hawx's own words:
>
> "I've got a sort of working LESS sugar. It doesn't like nested selectors at the moment, but mixins and variables are ok. Feel free to fork it and improve because I probably won't be spending much more time on it."
> 
> #STATUS#
>
> I stopped working on this for about a year, since I had switched over to Coda, but I recently switched back to Espresso (it has fewer features, but works a lot better with my workflow. Also, it's very pretty).
>
> I'm going to test variables and mixins, then get to work getting nesting to work properly.
>
> Also, I'm saving CodeSense for last.
